[FromQuery]
Use it when you want to get values from the URL query string.
Example: https://example.com/api/products?category=electronics&page=2
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult GetProducts([FromQuery] string category, [FromQuery] int page)
{
    return Ok($"Category: {category}, Page: {page}");
}
Use case: When you want to filter or paginate data (like ?search=apple&page=1).

2. [FromRoute]

Use it when you need values from the URL route parameters.
Example: https://example.com/api/products/5
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public IActionResult GetProductById([FromRoute] int id)
{
    return Ok($"Product ID: {id}");
}
Use case: When fetching a resource by ID or meaningful route segments.

3. [FromBody]

Use it when you expect data in the request body (JSON/XML).
Example: POST or PUT request with a JSON body.

{
    "name": "Laptop",
    "price": 999.99
}
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] Product product)
{
    return Ok($"Created product: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}");
}
Use case: When handling large data payloads (like creating or updating resources).
Note: do not use for GET requests (since they don’t have a body).

4. [FromForm]

Use it for form-data (e.g., file uploads, form submissions).
Example: multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded

[HttpPost("upload")]
public IActionResult UploadFile([FromForm] IFormFile file)
{
    return Ok($"File name: {file.FileName}");
}
Use case: Uploading images, handling forms, file processing.

5. [FromHeader]

Use it to extract values from HTTP headers.
Example: Custom headers like Authorization, User-Agent, etc.

[HttpGet("userinfo")]
public IActionResult GetUserInfo([FromHeader] string userAgent)
{
    return Ok($"User-Agent: {userAgent}");
}
Use case: Handling authentication tokens, user agents, custom headers.

6. [FromServices]

Use it when injecting dependencies directly into an action method.
Instead of constructor injection, you can inject services into a specific action:

[HttpGet("log")]
public IActionResult LogInfo([FromServices] ILogger<HomeController> logger)
{
    logger.LogInformation("Logging from action method");
    return Ok("Log recorded.");
}
Use case: When you need a service but don’t want to inject it into the constructor.
