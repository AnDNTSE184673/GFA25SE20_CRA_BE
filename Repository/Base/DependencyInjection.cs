 * Dependency injection (DI) is a technique for achieving loose coupling between objects and their collaborators, or dependencies.
 * Most often, classes will declare their dependencies via their constructor, allowing them to follow the Explicit Dependencies Principle.
 * This approach is known as "constructor injection".
 * To implement dependency injection, we need to configure a DI container with classes that is participating in DI.
 * DI Container has to decide whether to return a new instance of the service or provide an existing instance.
